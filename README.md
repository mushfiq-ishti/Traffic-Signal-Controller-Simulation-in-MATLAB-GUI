# Traffic-Signal-Controller-Simulation-in-MATLAB-GUI
This MATLAB GUI project simulates a traffic signal controller with a 15-second cycle.

The simulation includes 9 seconds of green light, 3 seconds of yellow light, and 3 seconds of red light, providing a realistic representation of traffic signal operation.
